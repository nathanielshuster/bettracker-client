## Reflection

I began this project while I was a student at Flatiron School. I had little experience with Redux and Hooks before this project and I wanted to be sure to implement them.

My original idea was to create an application geared towards bookkeepers. I realized the legal ramifications of this idea and how connecting payment options would become very complex, very fast. So I decided to instead build an application geared towards bettors.

One of the main challenges I ran into was using JWT tokens and Hooks for the first time. I had a bit of experience with both but nothing on this scale. At the time of this writing I can confidently say I have a thorough understanding of both.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Thunk, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. In the future I plan to refine the design and fix some small bugs that I have noticed, and implement error handling. I am sure than in time I can use this project as a starting point for my initial idea of making a bookkeeping application.
